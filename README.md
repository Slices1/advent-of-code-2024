# Info
## Intro
Hello

This is my first advent of code (AOC).

Although I mainly use C++, I am doing this challenge in python because I dont usually get the chance to practise it. I also think it is well suited for these kinds of tasks and so is what I would use for them anyway.

I have decided to leave the majoriy of my comments in as I think its interesting.

## How to run
name input files `input-1`, `input-2` etc based on the day of the script.
part 1 and part 2 python programs are usually in separate files, but if there is only one file then both will be in that file.

## Why is there one c++ file?
we don't talk about it (my previous algorithm was going to take 1.6 million years and I thought c++ could help ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )

## How did I place on the leaderboard
probably like 10 hundred thousandth globally but...
I took part in a private leaderboard with 30-40 something people and so far am 2nd.
